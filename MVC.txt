What is model binding?
Model binding maps data from HTTP requests to action method parameters.

Explain the importance of appsetting.json ?
it helps to store configuration information like connection string , version 

How to read configuration from appsetting.json ?
we use the IConfiguration object in the constructor which is injected by mvc core Dependency Injection

Explain Dependency injection?
DI is a practise of providing dependent object of a class is injected from outside the class rather than the class creating using the new keyword
It allows you to inject objects (services, repositories, etc.) that a class needs, rather than the class creating them itself
Instead of creating dependencies manually, they are provided to your class by the framework.

Why do we need DI?
by delegating object creation outside the caller we have better decoupled system .if we change at one place the changes are reflected across the application seamlessly

How we implement DI?
to implement Di we need to provide DI objects in ConfigureServices() method using scoped , singleton , transient 

Explain different ways of doing DI ?
Explain Scoped vs Transient vs Singleton?
Transient -Instantiates every single time service is injected 
Scoped -Instantiates once per request is made to server 
Singleton- Instantiates once in an application life time 

What is Middleware?
Middleware is a component that is part of the request and response pipeline in an ASP.NET Core application.
Middleware is code that runs between the HTTP request coming in and the HTTP response going out.

What is the use of Middleware ?
the user send request tot the controller , controller than invokes the model to access the data ,than controller applies that data to the view  and that is sent as a html 
Middle helps to execute the preprocessing logic before the request hits the controller 

How to create /implement middleware?
Add the middleware class using the template 
write the custom preprocessing logic in the invoke method 
In Configure() method we add the middleware in the request pipeline using app.UseMiddleWare<> code 

Why use startup.cs file ?
Startup.cs file helps to configure the DI and middleware
both the methods are called at the runtime  
ConfigureServices() - we Configure the Di -use this method to add services to the container 
Configure() - we add middleware - use this method to configure the the Http request pipeline

What is Razor ?
it is vieew engine in which we can write html and c# code together 
	
What is Routing ?
It is a process that maps the incoming HTTP request / Url to controller action 
Routing decides which controller and which action method should handle a specific URL.
{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}
{controller} → Name of the controller (e.g., ProductController)
{action} → Name of the action method (e.g., Details())
{id?} → Optional parameter (e.g., 5)
