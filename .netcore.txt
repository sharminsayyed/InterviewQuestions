WHAT IS THE ROLE OF PROGRAM.CS FILE IN ASP.NET CORE? OR WHAT 
IS CREATEHOSTBUILDER / CREATEDEFAULTBUILDER?
--->
Program.cs fille is the entry point of application via Main() method.  
Program.cs contains a CreateHostBuilder() method that uses CreateDefaultBuilder() to:
	Set up configuration (appsettings.json, environment variables, etc.)
	Set up logging
	Configure Kestrel web server
	Integrate dependency injection
CreateHostBuilder() was used in older projects (< .NET 6).
Newer projects hide it inside WebApplication.CreateBuilder().


WHAT IS THE ROLE OF STARTUP.CS FILE?
--->
In ASP.NET Core (before .NET 6), the Startup.cs file is the heart of application configuration — it tells your app what services to use and how to handle HTTP requests.
Role of Startup.cs
It is responsible for:
	Registering services that the app will use (Dependency Injection).
	Configuring the HTTP request pipeline (Middleware sequence).
	Setting up things like MVC, authentication, logging, CORS, etc.
ASP.NET Core 6 and later, Microsoft removed the separate Startup.cs file by default — its functionality is merged into Program.cs using the Minimal Hosting Model.
// Register services (Startup.cs → ConfigureServices)
builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews();
// Configure middleware pipeline (Startup.cs → Configure)
if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
}

Two main methods in Startup.cs:
1. ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
Optional method 
This method registers services for Dependency Injection (DI).
Everything here is application-level services — EF Core, Identity, Caching, Session, etc
2. Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
Not Optional method 
This method defines how the app responds to HTTP requests and response. 
It is used to setup request pipeline. — also called the middleware pipeline.
