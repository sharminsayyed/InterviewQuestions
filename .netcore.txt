WHAT IS THE ROLE OF PROGRAM.CS FILE IN ASP.NET CORE? OR WHAT 
IS CREATEHOSTBUILDER / CREATEDEFAULTBUILDER?
--->
Program.cs fille is the entry point of application via Main() method.  
Program.cs contains a CreateHostBuilder() method that uses CreateDefaultBuilder() to:
	Set up configuration (appsettings.json, environment variables, etc.)
	Set up logging
	Configure Kestrel web server
	Integrate dependency injection
CreateHostBuilder() was used in older projects (< .NET 6).
Newer projects hide it inside WebApplication.CreateBuilder().
